# Task-1 
Develop an ansible that runs a dockerized web application (nginx, php, mysql) using docker-compose on a remote server.
The playbook should:
1. Distribute the files necessary for work
2. Generate a configuration file for nginx, and, if necessary, restart it.

The result of completing the technical specifications is:
1. Ansible playbook (together with roles and/or a file with dependencies, necessary templates);
2. docker-compose.yml
3. Dockerfile
